# NOT A REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION

Everything in this repo is *wrong* and innately *insecure* 

It could however be used for demonstrating aspects of the login flow.

This config assumes hosting on http://localhost:5201/

It will perform a round trip to the auth.jppol.dk and assume a token is returned. 

There is no error handling and nothing is treated securely.

Use regular 'donet run' to start the app.
