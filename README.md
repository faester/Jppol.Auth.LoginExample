= NOT A REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION =
Everything in this repo is wrong and innately insecure. 

It could however be used for demonstrating aspects of the login flow.

This config assumes hosting on http://localhost:5000/

It will perform a round trip to the auth.jppol.dk and assume a token is returned. 

There is no error handling and nothing is treated securely.
